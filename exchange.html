                            study in a different country and environment experiencing the history and culture of another
                            country, as well as meeting new friends to enrich their personal development. International
                            exchange programmmes are also effective to challenge students to develop a global
                            perspective. BITS Pilani encourages such programmes with partner universities. Costs for the
                            programme vary by the country and institution. Participants fund their participation through
                            some scholarship schemes of the universities and/or self-funding. This can be a short-term
                            exchange programme during the summer vacation or long term programmes ranging from one
                            semester to one academic year. For the long term programme student has to register for the
                            course(s) of a degree requirement.

                                Thesis, Semester Abroad Program, Summer Internship Programme. There are a vast number
                                of summer internship opportunities available to the students. The students at the institutes
                                have actively taken part in these programmes and avail the scholarship opportunities offered

                                partner universities of BITS Pilani. On an average 200 students of BITS-Pilani avail the
                                international summer internship in an academic year. This is a continuous process and the

                                <br><br>
                                (a)<strong> Off Campus Thesis (OCT):</strong>
                                Students can opt for off campus thesis abroad in their final year of their respective programme
                                to get an opportunity to work with the researchers of their interests in foreign universities.
                                While choosing for the off campus thesis, students should look into the profile of the
                                proposed supervisor and the ranking of the foreign university. Then the students need to
                                follow the guidelines for the application procedure for OCT as prescribed by
                                AUGSD/AGSRD. IPCD provides partial financial support to limited short-listed students.
                                The application format for off campus partial funding application is here. In every academic
                                year more than 200 students opt for the OCT in foreign universities. During this period,
                                students get good exposure of the top leading universities across the globe. The outcome of
                                OCT often resulted in the publication in journals/conference proceeding and for higher studies
                                (MS, Ph.D.) in the foreign universities.
                                <br><br>

                                is no MoU signed between the university and BITS Pilani. For deciding course equivalence,
                                the student can apply in the prescribed form to HoD who will approve the equivalence or will

                            IPCD seeks to collect the best available resources to make advances in science and education. Bearing this in mind, Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) are signed with various universities / industries, both in India and abroad.

                        research on return to campus. Creating such an environment for immersion of faculty in an
                        University set-up, can take many forms including exposure oriented visits, internships, guest
                        instruction, participating in on-going/pipeline projects, case studies, short/long term research
                        work at the University abroad. Locations for international immersion may vary and facilitated
                        through the Faculty Affairs Division, priority is given for immersion in Universities with whom
                        BITS has collaborations, agreement for faculty exchange. The faculty affairs division of BITS
                        Pilani every year seeks application from eligible faculty members for an international visit under
                        University Immersion Scheme (https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/university/FAD/Opportunities). In
                        last five years many faculty members of the institute have been benefited from this Scheme to
                        visit leading universities of the world.
                        <br><br>
                        (ii)<strong>International Research Collaborations:</strong> Research is an integral and important part of any
                        higher education system. BITS Pilani, actively promotes international research and
                        collaborations among its staff and students. In addition to basic research, which is the backbone
                        of any applied research, the Institute also gives adequate importance and support to applied
                        research. Faculty members having an ongoing international research grant can visit the university
                        with which the grant has been sanctioned. Presently, there are thirty-three international joint
                        projects ongoing in collaboration with leading universities, institutes and research labs across the
                        world.
                        <br><br>

                        in national and international conferences and thereby network with experts from India and
                        abroad. Faculty members can use their special contingency grant singly or in combination with
                        other travel grant which they may have procured through different agencies (INSA, DST, CSIR
                        etc). For the last five years, trend of participation by faculty members in international conference
                        and workshops is continue to grow which in turn will strengthen the ongoing efforts towards
                        greater understanding and collaboration at international level.
